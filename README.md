# KSP Orbital Darkness calculator

This calculator enables you to:

* How long your vessel will be in darkness

* Calculate how much EC you will need to retain control over an orbiting vessel
* Calculate how much EC/s you will need to recharge your batteries

Based on the formulas provided in the [KSP wiki](https://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Orbit_darkness_time).

Site theme from the excellent [andrewbanchich/forty-jekyll-theme](https://andrewbanchich.github.io/forty-jekyll-theme/).

I own none of this code - if it helps you, credit it.
